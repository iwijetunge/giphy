Application Description

The user is presented with 10 buttons with pre filled labels.  I chose a vegetable theme.

The user can also add buttons to the list, by typing in the ‘Add’ input field and pressing the ‘Submit’ button.  The newly added button will have the label that the user typed in the input field.

Pressing any button will load 10 gifs from the https://giphy.com/ that were based on a search of the button label. The rating of each gif is diplayed.

Clicking on each image will activate the gif. Clicking again will pause the gif.
